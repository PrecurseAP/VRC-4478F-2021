Well this is it, our fantastic robot code for the 2021-2022 tipping point season. We are now all seniors and this is our last year, so im trying to go all out with this.
the code has many features: odometry, path following (wip), precisely tuned pid movement, graphing, and mediocre ui. feel free to look at this if you need help figuring out
how to make code of your own :)
