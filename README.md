# what
this is the code for vex robotics competition team 4478F. is very good

#todo
1. fix up drive. chains are loose, too inconsistent. i will probably switch to using gears, or direct drive.
2. wiring. those shits get caught everywhere.
3. the tilt. slip the left side gears a little bit, to sync them with the right
4. cube guidance. have some way of guiding cubes into the holder.
5. make the claw motor a 36:1, rather than 18:1. less heat, more power.
6. anti tips. up, up, and right to the ground we go.
7. clean up joints. everything is so messy, especially the holder assembly.
8. practice, practice, practice. get to know the rules, and become better.
